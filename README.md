Finally!!!

This is my first repository!

I know it doesn't seem like much but setting up this repository helped me to understand some basic git commands, personal access tokens, and linking to github.
I followed an old video tutorial to download git and push files to my first repository.
I ran into some issues with the authentication. Git had been updated the day before to version 2.39 and I would get a warning: Unable to locate UI Helper 'Github.UI'.
After losing some hair and digging around on google and stack overflow and the github documentation I managed to find the solution.
I uninstalled V2.39 and installed v2.38. Apparently v2.38 doesn't have the UI Helper issue.
I tried the same commands and pushed to github and this time it allowed me to enter my github credentials.
I ran into another problem with the password. Github removed the option to authenticate with the account password in August/April 2021.
Instead I was directed to create a Personal Access Token to use as the password for my credentials.
This was the final missing piece of the puzzle.

I look forward to playing around with this sample repository to learn more.
